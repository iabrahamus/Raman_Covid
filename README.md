# Rapid COVID-19 Diagnosis using Raman Spectroscopy and Machine Learning
## Problem Context
Diagnosing COVID-19 with the currently used technology - real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is not without limitations. Though it
is sensitive, but has to be conducted in a sophisticated and controlled laboratory environment and hence increases the turn arround time.
Turn arround time is critical to effectively mitigate pendemics. An alternative technology that is both sensitive and fast in demand to
tackle current pendemic crisis as well as any potential future pendemics.

## Proposed solution

We propose the use Machine Learning coupled with Raman spectroscopy as a safe, rapid, and efficient method for diagnosing COVID-19. 

## Dataset and Employed ML models

Using dataset consisting of Raman spectra of serum samples collected from 150 patients and 150 healthy control individuals, 
we develop a machine learning model based on Logistic regression, decision trees and Random Forest to seamlessly detect COVID-19.,
